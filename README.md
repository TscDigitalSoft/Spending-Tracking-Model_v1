This App takes a bank PDF and translates it in to a Google sheet. So that you can better track spending. 

It also uses a model trained on previous personal bank transactions to try to guess what the purchases was for. Such as Food Gas ect.

After looking the new statement over you can then change any awnser that were wrong and turn the corrected data in to a csv to train a new model with more accuracy. 
so the more you use it the more accurate it will become.
